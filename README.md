# cpp_project
C++ school Assignment 
This is a C++ assignment that I have done for my C++ modules. 

Context of what the project does:
1) This program will read all the required data from a csv file.
2) The program will then store all the data in a mixture of data structures. The data structures that I have used for this project is a Map and a BST.
3) There will be a menu which contain options that allow the users to choose on how to manipulate the data. 
- For example, one of the option is Display the average for a certain month and year. 


Files provided:
1) The data folder
2) A test.cpp for all the different class that is used to test whether the class is working. 
3) A folder that shows doxygen
